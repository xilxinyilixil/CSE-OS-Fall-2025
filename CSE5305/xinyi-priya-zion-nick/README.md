# Our Project:
**→ Implemention of FIFO and SJF Schedulers**
* For the first part of our project, we implemented the First In First Out and Shortest Job First schedulers
* We calculated their response and turnaround times for comparison 
* Then we tested these results with different case scenarios to see the performance of each

**→ Implemention of FIFO Quantum to SJF**
* For the second part of our project, we implemented a new hybrid scheduler
* Scheduling Policy:
    * All jobs are processed with FIFO scheduler
    * After a fixed quantum (2 ms) it switches to the SJF scheduler
* Made calculations of the response and turnaround times for this hybrid scheduler
* Compared it to our first part, where jobs were processed using either FIFO or SJF
